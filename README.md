# rust-cheatsheet
just a little file u can reference to in case u forgot the syntax of something, mostly making this for myself but if someone finds some error or something feel free to point it out, most of the things here come directly from rust's official book. Also don't even try compiling syntax.rs, it isn't a rust program, the only reason it's a rust file is to get syntax highlighting in all editors
